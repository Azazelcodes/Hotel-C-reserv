# Hotel-C-reserv
A old C program I made. It's a simple menu driven program but I made it a little complex by including the concept of nodes and daughter nodes. The basic function runs on the If else and Case loops

The menu is somewhat like this:

What do you want to do? 
 1. Allot a room 
 2. Delete an alloted room
 3. View all the alloted rooms along with the student details 
 4. To search any particular room 
 5. View the number of rooms alloted 
 6. Exit	 : 
 
 If we choose the first option, it displays
